# Batch-Gradient-Descent-Linear-Regression

Batch Gradient Descent & Linear-Regression implementation

Gradient descent method was used for a 2 class classification problem. 
The data set contains a total of 4000 samples of 2 classes. Class-1 and 
Class-2 data are labeled. For this data set, 50 iterations were applied 
and the learning rate was selected 0.2. Ä°f you want to change these 
parameters you can do it. So You can see a change in the performance of 
the algorithm.
